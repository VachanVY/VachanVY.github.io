# Blog Posts Directory

This directory contains all the blog posts for the academic website. Each blog post is written in Markdown and converted to HTML using the site generator.

## Quick Start

1. **Copy the template**: Use `sample-blog-post.md` as your starting point
2. **Rename the file**: Give it a descriptive name (e.g., `my-research-project.md`)
3. **Edit the content**: Replace the sample content with your own
4. **Generate HTML**: Run `python generate_site.py` from the root directory
5. **Update the main site**: Add your post to the blog section in `index.html`

## File Naming Convention

- Use lowercase letters only
- Separate words with hyphens (-)
- Use descriptive names that reflect the content
- Examples: `machine-learning-tutorial.md`, `conference-review-2024.md`

## Required Format

Every blog post must start with:

```markdown
# Your Post Title

*Published: Month Day, Year*

Your content goes here...
```
