<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h2>Formatting Guide</h2>

<p>Here are some common formatting examples you can use in your blog posts:</p>

<h3>Headers</h3>

<p>Use different levels of headers to organize your content:</p>

<p><code>`</code>markdown
<h1>Main Title (H1) - used for the post title</h1>
<h2>Section Header (H2)</h2>
<h3>Subsection Header (H3)</h3>
<code>`</code></p>

<h3>Text Styling</h3>

<p>You can make text <strong>bold</strong> using double asterisks or <em>italic</em> using single asterisks.</p>

<h3>Links</h3>

<p>Create links like this: <a href="https://github.com/VachanVY/VachanVY.github.io">GitHub Repository</a></p>

<h3>Lists</h3>

<p>Create bulleted lists:

<p>Or numbered lists:

3. Third step</p>

<h3>Code</h3>

<p>Use backticks for <code>inline code</code> or code blocks for longer snippets.</p>

<p>1. Open <code>index.html</code>
2. Find the blog section
3. Add a new list item for your post following the existing format
